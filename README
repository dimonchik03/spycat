To start application download repo and main folder run it using Docker: docker-compose up -d --build

Imagine you are the boss of SCA.
So, to manipulate your cats you must be authorized. (username - admin, password - password)
After authorization you can do CRUD operations with any model you want.
All commands are created in postman collection. (SpyCatAgency API json file)

All variables are written in .env file. I did not add to gitignore as there is no sense in privacy.
